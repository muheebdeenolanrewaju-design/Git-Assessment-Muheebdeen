My name is Muheebdeen Olanrewaju Akanbi, I am a recent engineering graduate with a solid academic foundation in maths, physics and applied electricity, now actively pivoting into the field of coding and Programming. To bridge this gap, I am currently learning the basics of back-end programming where I am developing hands-on proficiency on how to use power shell and github. My background has equipped me with strong knowledge in electrical wring and Autocad, which allow me to approach new technical challenges with a disciplined, analytical mindset. As a dedicated and fast learner, I am eager to contribute my fresh perspective and growing expertise to a forward-thinking team in the nearest future.
